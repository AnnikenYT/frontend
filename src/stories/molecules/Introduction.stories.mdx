# ðŸ§¬ Molecules

Molecules are small, reusable components that represent a single piece of UI. Different to atoms, molecules can depend on other components (mostly Atoms) to function.
Usually they are less universal than atoms, but are still able to be used in different ways.
The best example of this is the **Avatar Component**, which is a component that can be used to represent a user's avatar. It uses the **Loading** atom to display a loading indicator while the avatar is being loaded.

## In Conclusion:
Everything that

- depends on other components
- can be used in different ways
- has self-contained logic that doesn't affect application state

should be made into a **Molecule**
