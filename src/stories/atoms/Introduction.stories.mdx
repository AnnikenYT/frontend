# ⚛️ Atoms
Atoms are like the smallest building blocks of the project. They should not be dependent on other components, and should be highly configurable.
Then should'nt contain a lot of logic, and what logic there is should be self contained and not affecting the application state.
As the smallest building blocks of the project, they should be **as reusable as possible**. Every new component adds complexity and complicates maintainability.
Still keep in mind, that its better to abstract everything into a component, than having rougue code in the view.
## In Conclusion:
Everything that is

- Used more than once in the application
- Not dependent on other components
- Can be self contained and not affecting the application state

should be made into an **Atom**.
