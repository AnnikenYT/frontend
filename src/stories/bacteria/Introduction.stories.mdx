# ðŸ¦  Bacteria
Bacteria components are **single use** components. While they can be used in multiple parts of the app, they should always be used in the same context. They should *not* have props which control major parts of their behavior. They may also alter application state.

## In Conclusion:
Everything that

- is single use
- is not a major part of the app
- does alter application state

should be made into a Bacteria component.
